Question 1:
Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50.
```{r}
for (i in 1:50){
  print(i)
}
```

Question 2:
A. Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.
```{r}
sum = 0
for (i in 0:1000){
  sum = sum + i
}
sum
```

B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())
```{r}
even = 0
for (i in 1:1000){
  if (i %% 2){
  even = even + i
  }
}
even
```

C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.
```{r}
x <- 0:1000
sum(x)
xeven <- x[lapply(x, "%%", 2) == 0]
sum(xeven)
```

Question 3:
Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :
```{r}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
```
The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.
```{r}
survey.clean <- for (i in survey){
  if (i >= 1, i <=5){
    print(i)
  } else {
      print("NA")
    }
}
```
B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called “invalid.answers” that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.
```{r}
invalid.answers <- for (i in survey.clean){
  if (i == "NA"){
    sum = 
  }
}
```
