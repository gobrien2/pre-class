Reading in the dataset
```{r}
library(foreign)
wcgs <- read.dta("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B8CsRLdwqzbzYWxfN3ExQllBQkU")
```

Question 1: Standardize Function
A. Create a function called standardize.me() that takes a numeric vector as an argument, and returns the standardized version of the vector. 
```{r}
standardize.me <- function(x){
  for (i in x){
    abs(i -mean(x))/sd(x)
  }
}
```
B. Assign all the numeric columns of the original WCGS dataset to a new dataset called WCGS.new. 
```{r}
WCGS.new_temp <- unlist(lapply(wcgs, is.numeric))
WCGS.new <- wcgs[, WCGS.new_temp]
```

C. Using a loop and your new function, standardize all the variables WCGS.new dataset.
```{r}
for (x in ncol(WCGS.new)){
  standardize.me(x)
}
```
D. What should the mean and standard deviation of all your new standardized variables be? Test your prediction by running a loop
```{r}
for (x in ncol(WCGS.new)){
  mean(x)
  sd(x)
}
```
Mean should be 1 and standard deviation should be 0. 

Question 2: Looping to Calculate
A. Using a loop, calculate the mean weight of the subjects separated by the type of CHD they have. 

B. Now do the same thing, but now don't use a loop
